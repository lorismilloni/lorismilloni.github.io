                        <p>My name is Loris, a 28-year-old woman with a strong passion for creativity, art, sports, and technology. As a lifelong learner, I thrive on understanding people's needs and aspire to make technology more user-friendly and genuinely helpful. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Information Systems at State University of Tocantins (UNITINS), Brazil, while looking for my first opportunity in a tech company. My journey began in a different field, as I had a previous career in Portuguese Literature and English translation.<br><br>
                        However, my love for technology was evident through my knack for troubleshooting computer issues for family and friends, as well as my passion for using shell scripts in my Linux distribution over the past 14 years. In 2021, with the rapid growth of remote work, I decided to dive deep into the programming universe. I enrolled in a one-year Bootcamp, where I dedicated myself to honing my web development skills until December 2022. During this intensive program, I completed numerous exercises and worked on substantial projects while utilizing code versioning tools such as Git and GitHub.</p>

                            <p>
                            Throughout my learning journey, I acquired proficiency in various languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, MySQL, HTML, and CSS.<br>
                            Currently, I am further strengthening my Java knowledge while independently studying Ruby on Rails. This additional focus will enable me to pursue a career path in DevOps and Backend development.<br><br>
                            Aside from technical skills, I am passionate about developing my logical thinking abilities. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn, email, or explore my GitHub repositories and personal blog.<br>
