                    <h1>Adjusting the course, once again</h1>
                </header>
                <p>When I enrolled in the Trybe bootcamp, I had a routine of studying alone in the mornings. Classes ran from 2 to 8 p.m., and in the evenings, I continued my studies to complete the projects. It was a period of both learning and exhaustion, as the amount of content became overwhelming.</p>

                <p>Towards the end of the course, I noticed a decline in job opportunities in the technology market. The pressure of not being able to find work, coupled with mental fatigue, left me feeling disheartened. I began to doubt whether I had made the right choice.</p>

                <p>Changing careers is undoubtedly challenging. Leaving behind years of experience and investing in a dream only to face uncertainty is no easy feat. After completing the bootcamp, I realized the importance of further education. I decided to pursue a university degree to enhance my resume and potentially secure an internship. It was a realization that my original plan hadn't panned out. After 13 months of coursework, I found myself without a job and in need of a new plan.</p>

                <p>During this period of reassessment, I rediscovered my passion by returning to university. I focused on building a solid foundation and deepening my knowledge of technology, computers, networks, and architecture. I let go of external pressures and found peace within myself. It reaffirmed that changing careers was the right decision because I truly love what I do. However, it also became clear that following the prescribed path dictated by others wasn't the answer. I realized that my old portfolio didn't reflect who I truly was. It was time for a change.</p>

                <p>With this realization, I decided to redesign my portfolio, taking inspiration from the 90s, an era I particularly enjoyed. The transformation allowed me to better express myself. Here's how I went about it:</p>

                <p>- I began by sketching out the layout on paper, envisioning how I wanted the website to look. I made a list of essential elements and gradually brought the design to life.</p>

                <p>- Throughout the process, I identified areas that needed improvement and made the necessary adjustments.</p>

                <p>- I incorporated a slider to showcase the projects I had completed during the bootcamp, gradually adding them to the portfolio.</p>

                <p>- I felt it was important to have a section that provided a detailed account of my journey, in case potential recruiters stumbled upon my portfolio.</p>

                <p>- To create a more professional-looking resume, I chose to use Notion, as it offered a format that aligned with my goals, different from the playful style of the rest of the website.</p>

                <p>- I also wanted to have a blog where I could share my thoughts and study summaries. I aimed to have it up and running quickly so that I could start publishing my work right away. I made sure it was generated within the main &lt;div&gt; of the blog page, and I wrote some JavaScript code to accomplish that.</p>

                <p>For the sake of simplicity and easy deployment on GitHub Pages, I decided to use plain JavaScript. Some of my friends who opted for React expressed frustration with the complexity of its configuration and making changes. As for CSS, I chose to practice my skills with pure CSS and the logic of flexbox, but in my other projects, I often rely on frameworks.</p>

                <p>I haven't added a comments section yet, and I don't foresee the need for it in the near future. But who knows what lies ahead.</p>

                <p>Here are my layout and some of the references I drew inspiration from:</p>
